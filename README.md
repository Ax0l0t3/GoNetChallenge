Application Architecture
  Would be a Monolithic All-in-one architecture. Since its a simple application and the core of its functionality is inside the application. This suits perfectly.

Thrd party Libraries Used
  Bootsrap
    Bootsrap is the most popular library out there for styling and giving interactivity to a webpage.
    I've used it in the past, that's the main reason why I chose to use it now(Though, in Angular).
  React-Icons
    A library of popular icons. Thought would be a nice idea to change the favourite radio input. Using an icon instead of a button.
    
Improvement
  -First and foremost, to finish the Application with all the requirements.
  -I would like to add a little bit more of UX. Not to change the appliation layout, but to make the page more dynamic .i.e: when adding an element as a favourite, a little animation
  to the button would be nice. Little subtle things to deliver a better experience.
  -Add a little bit of security: Confidentiality (Prevent disclosure of data to thirds); Integrity (Ensure we're getting trustworth data); Availability (Ensure data being accesible to end users despite any server errors)
  
Incomplete Assesments
  -Part-2 challenge. For it i was thinking to add a routes module so i can navigate through it. Or instead, bootstrap has some sort of "Pop-up Cards". Maybe those ones.
  -Mostly i would say the reason not delivering the entire application, missing time. And honestly, a lack of background knowledge. Won't be the most outstanding reason,  but it is as it is.
  
Final Thoughts
  I would like to end just by saying, you won't regret having me on your team. Sounds a little to presumptuous. And specially when i couldn't deliver the full application.
  But, the heart of the matter here is, i'have another job. Whilst, be it an example of what I can do if my compromise would be with you.
  I highly value the given opportunities. So, you won't regret it.
